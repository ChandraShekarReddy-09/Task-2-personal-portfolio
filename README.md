# Task-2-personal-portfolio
Finishing Task 2!   I'm happy to share that I've finished Task 2 of Level 1 for my internship at Codsoft, which asked me to build a personal portfolio. This task was a great opportunity for me to show my skills, creativity, and progress as a software developer. It has been great to design and build a portfolio that displays my technical skills
